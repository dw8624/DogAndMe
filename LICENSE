This project is based on the CNN model structure from:
- Original Repository: https://github.com/Tiwarim386/Dog_Breed_Classifier_CNN
- Author: Tiwarim386
- Referenced Components: VGG16-based dog breed classification model architecture

The original work provided the foundation for the machine learning model, 
which has been adapted and integrated into a FastAPI web application with 
significant enhancements in user interface, deployment, and functionality.
